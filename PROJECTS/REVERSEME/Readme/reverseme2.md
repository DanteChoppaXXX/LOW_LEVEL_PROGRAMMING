# 🔥 Dynamic Function Reconstruction – Full Algorithm (No Code)

> 🔑 Dynamic function reconstruction is how malware, crackmes, and stealth binaries hide their secrets.

### 🧩 Step 1: Write a Simple Password Check Function

* First, in a **separate file**, write a small function that checks whether a string equals a hardcoded password.
* For example:

  ```c
  int check(char *input) { return strcmp(input, "deepflow") == 0; }
  ```

> You’ll later **compile this separately**, extract its machine code, and embed that in your main program.

---

### 🧠 Step 2: Extract Function Bytecode

* Use `objdump -d`, `ndisasm`, or `gdb` to **disassemble and isolate just the machine code bytes** for that function.
* Write down the exact bytes (e.g., `0x55 0x89 0xe5 ...`).
* Make sure you know where the function starts and ends.

> This is your **raw byte representation** of the logic, like malware payloads do.

---

### 🛠️ Step 3: Encode the Bytecode

* Use XOR or any simple encoding (like `~byte`, adding a key, etc.) to obfuscate each byte.
* Create a byte array in your real program with these encoded bytes.
* Store them as something like:

  ```c
  unsigned char encoded_function[] = {0xXX ^ KEY, 0xYY ^ KEY, ...};
  ```

---

### 🗃️ Step 4: Allocate Executable Memory

* Use a system call like `mmap()` (Linux) or `VirtualAlloc()` (Windows) to allocate a memory region that is:

  * Writable ✅
  * Executable ✅
* This memory region will be your secret function at runtime.

---

### 🧬 Step 5: Decode the Bytes Into Memory

* Decode the obfuscated bytes (XOR with the same key) into the allocated executable memory.
* You’re **reconstructing the logic** dynamically in RAM.

---

### 🧭 Step 6: Cast as a Function Pointer

* Cast the memory pointer to a function pointer of the same type as your original password check function.
* Example:

  ```c
  typedef int (*func_ptr)(char *);
  func_ptr secret_check = (func_ptr)exec_memory;
  ```

---

### 🔓 Step 7: Call the Reconstructed Function

* Call it like a regular function:

  ```c
  if (secret_check(user_input)) { // access granted }
  ```

* The logic executes from memory you dynamically rebuilt. 😎

---

### 🎯 Step 8: Test & Debug

* Use GDB to step through it. You’ll notice:

  * The password is **not in the binary**.
  * The function logic appears only in memory at runtime.
  * Tools like `strings`, `objdump`, and even disassemblers won’t see the full logic statically.

---

## 🧠 What You’ve Just Learned to Do

* **Runtime polymorphism** — code built at runtime.
* **Stealth logic** — the real logic never lives in plain sight.
* **Reverse engineering resistance** — an attacker must debug live code.
